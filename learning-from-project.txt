the run commands used:
 1. npm run dev - to run the react app
 2. node api/index.js - to run the particular backend file

 now everytime you change the index.js express folder, the backend output doesnt change. 
 You need to restart it everytime, for it to show a different output.
 Since that is annoying and time consuming, we use "nodemon" so that it automatically refreshes, without having to restart it everytime.
